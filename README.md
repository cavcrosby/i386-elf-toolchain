# i386-elf-compiler-collection

A collection of precompiled versions of i386-elf-gcc for different architectures.

Check out the [Releases](https://github.com/danirod/i386-elf-compiler-collection/releases) page where I'll upload
precompiled versions of the i386-elf-gcc and i386-elf-binutils for different platforms. I'll provide a build
script later in case you want to build i386-elf on your own on your machine.

The following architectures have been tested at the moment and are known to work:

* Linux x86-64 (tested on Arch).
* MacOS X x86-64 (tested on 10.11).
* Windows x86 (tested on Windows 7; tested on Windows 10 by guerra24).

The following architectures are waiting to be tested.

* Windows x86-64.
* Linux x86.
* FreeBSD x86.
* FreeBSD x86-64.
